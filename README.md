# cybersecurity
 I'm storing here my little projects about cybersecurity. In the future, if they grow enough, I will consider moving them to an independent repository.

## projects
- [cypher](https://github.com/shemphys/cybersecurity/tree/main/cypher): a simple program to cypher docs using a hash made with pass+salt

- [IP_MAC_hidder](https://github.com/shemphys/cybersecurity/tree/main/IP_MAC_hidder): I have been told that it is good to know how to stay hidden when needed. I attempt to give my first steps towards that goal with this project.
